<p>Hello There!!
Welcome to my blog, Trampled Terra-Traveler in Trouble!!
My on-line name is Grime J.
I just began studying programming in 3~4 month ago. So, I’m not beginner class, yet.
                         
I don’t have fund, stamina, knowledgement, intelligence, but I just have passion, and fun when I’m studying.</p>

<p>Currently, I’m intereted with</p>

  <li>What can I do? (As a Job)</li>
  <li>What can I do? (As a Hobby)</li>
  <li>What can I do? (AS a One)</li>
</ol>

<p>I’m not fluent natural(include my mother-language, korean) &amp; computer language, both.

I use this blog just for logging my code, and for someone just like me.</p>
