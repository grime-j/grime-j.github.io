<br/>

Hello There!!
<br/>
Welcome to my blog, Trampled Terra-Traveler in Trouble!!
<br/>
My on-line name is Grime J.
I just began studying programming in 3~4 month ago. 
<br/>
So, I'm not beginner class, yet. I don't have fund, stamina, knowledgement, intelligence, 
<br/>
but I just have passion, and fun when I'm studying.


Currently, I'm intereted with 
1. What can I do? (As a Job)
2. What can I do? (As a Hobby, or Fun)
3. What can I do? (As a Living one)

I'm not fluent natural(include my mother-language, korean) & computer language, both.
<br/>
So, This blog is not helpful for many senior programmers.
<br/>
I use this blog just for logging my code, and for someone just like me.
<br/>
If you want to contact me, Please send <a href="mailto:treepple.j@gmail.com?subject=free chocolate">e-mail</a> to me.
